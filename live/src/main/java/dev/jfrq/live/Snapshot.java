/**
 * One dump of a window of a running recording, the way {@code jcmd JFR.dump} does it:
 * clone the recording and stop the clone, which seals the chunk being written so the
 * newest events are in a finished chunk; stream the clone's chunks that overlap the
 * window into a file; close the clone. The recording itself is not touched.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is left behind, even when the dump is cut short: a shutdown hook, in place from
 * before the clone exists until it is closed, closes it and removes the partial file on
 * Ctrl-C or {@code SIGTERM}. A stopped clone left in the JVM would pin its chunks on disk
 * until the JVM exits. The hook waits for the JVM at most {@link Cleanup#HOOK_TIMEOUT}: a
 * JVM that does not answer (stopped with {@code SIGSTOP}, hung) cannot keep this process
 * from exiting, and the clone it keeps is named on standard error.
 *
 * @param file  where the dump was written
 * @param bytes its size
 * @param stop  when the clone was stopped: the exact end of the last chunk in the file,
 *              and the point the next delta continues from
