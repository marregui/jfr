# Usage

Every command, option and output rule of `jfrq`. [RECORDING.md](RECORDING.md) covers how
to make a recording; [LIVE.md](LIVE.md) covers `jfrq-live`; [JSON.md](JSON.md) lists the
`--json` fields; [design/](design/README.md) explains how each answer is reached.

## 1. Requirements

- JDK 25 to build and run (`jdk.jfr` is part of the JDK; the tool has no other dependency).
- Recordings from any JDK 17+ JVM. Allocation analysis prefers `jdk.ObjectAllocationSample`
  (JDK 16+) and falls back to the TLAB events on older files.

## 2. Build and install

```
./gradlew build          # compiles, runs 440+ tests, checks coverage, Javadoc (doclint) and imports
./gradlew installDist    # cli/build/install/jfrq/bin/jfrq, live/build/install/jfrq-live/bin/jfrq-live,
                         # netty-demo/build/install/netty-demo/bin/netty-demo
```

Put `cli/build/install/jfrq/bin` (and `live/build/install/jfrq-live/bin`) on your `PATH`,
or call the scripts by path.

The launcher runs the JVM in `JAVA_HOME` when that is set and a `java` from the `PATH`
only when it is not; either way it must be JDK 25, so an older `JAVA_HOME` is not rescued
by a newer `java` on the `PATH`.

The first run writes an AppCDS archive to `lib/jfrq.jsa` next to the jars, which makes
every later run start in about a tenth of a second; if the directory is not writable
nothing is written and start-up is merely ordinary.

JVM options go in `JFRQ_OPTS` (`jfrq`) or `JFRQ_LIVE_OPTS` (`jfrq-live`):
`JFRQ_OPTS=-Xmx4g` for a very large recording, or
`JFRQ_OPTS="-XX:StartFlightRecording=filename=self.jfr"` to record jfrq itself.

## 3. Synopsis

```
jfrq info   recording.jfr [--thread GLOB [--top N]] [--html out.html] [--json]
jfrq health recording.jfr [more.jfr ...] [--top N] [--html out.html] [--json]
jfrq alloc  recording.jfr [--baseline before.jfr] [--top N] [--sites] [--app PREFIX] [--html out.html] [--json]
jfrq locks  recording.jfr [--min 10ms] [--thread GLOB] [--lock GLOB] [--idle REGEX,...] [--by-site] [--top N] [--html out.html] [--json]
jfrq stalls recording.jfr --thread GLOB [--gap 50ms] [--idle REGEX,...] [--top N] [--html out.html] [--json]
```

Common options: `--top N` (rows per table, default 15; for `info`, the creators `--thread`
lists), `--html FILE`, `--json`, `--timing`, `--version`, `--help`.

## 4. Output

Every command prints plain text for a terminal or a ticket, and writes a self-contained
HTML report with `--html`. A 40 MB recording is answered in about a quarter of a second;
`--timing` shows where the time went ([design, section 5](design/README.md#5-performance)).

`--json` prints the answer as one JSON document instead of text, for a program or an
agent to read: stable field names with the unit in the name, instants in UTC, `null` where
the recording cannot say, and a `schema` number that changes only when a field does.
[JSON.md](JSON.md) lists every field.

Every time `jfrq` and `jfrq-live` print is UTC and says so: a wait, a convoy, a stall or a
pause is printed as its offset from the recording's start and its time of day,
`+13.682s 11:37:15.286Z`, so the line in a log written beside the recording can be found
without converting by hand.

Every number states its basis. A number that rests on sampling says so and says how far
the sampling can be trusted; the allocation estimate is printed next to the JVM's own
counters; a truncated file is read as far as it goes and every report says where it
stops; a file still being written is refused with the command that produces a readable
one, instead of the parser hanging on it.

## 5. Arguments

**Thread globs.** `GLOB` is a comma-separated list of shell globs on thread names (`*`,
`?`, `[0-3]`, `[!0-9]`; a backslash makes the next character literal): `'event-loop-*'`,
`'nioEventLoopGroup-*,worker-?'`.

**Durations** take a unit (`50ms`, `1.5s`, `2m`).

**Options belong to their command**, so a `stalls` option on `locks` is an error rather
than silently ignored, and so is an option given twice.

**Waits at the edges.** A wait or a block that began before the recording, or outlived it,
is counted only for the part inside it, and that is the part `--min` and `--gap` are
measured against.

## 6. `info`

`jfrq info` says what is in the file: its span, its threads, event counts, and the
thresholds and periods that were active when it was made. It lists the threads in a `THREADS` table folded into families, one row per
family with its count, how many some event names, and an example (`load-client-N*`, `8`,
`8`, `load-client-1`).

**Census.** When the recording holds the JVM's thread census
(`jdk.ThreadAllocationStatistics`) and `jdk.ThreadStart`/`jdk.ThreadEnd`, as both JDK
profiles do, each family also says how many threads were alive when the recording began,
started, ended, and were alive when it ended: a leak is an `At end` that grows window
after window, which the count of threads seen in a window cannot show.

**CPU.** When the recording has `jdk.ThreadCPULoad` (both JDK profiles, every 10 s) each
family has its `CPU`, its share of the JVM's CPUs (the machine's, unless
`-XX:ActiveProcessorCount`, a container limit or a CPU affinity mask sets fewer) across
the window. Each reading is weighed by the stretch it covers, since the thread's last
evaluation or its start; a reading at the first evaluation of a thread alive before the
recording covers a stretch the file does not hold, and the readings of a thread native
code attached hold CPU the native thread used before the attach until one comes in below
one core, so both are left out, and the line under the table says how many were. A
recording shorter than two periods shows little for the threads that were already
running.

**Attached threads.** `Attached` counts the threads native code attached to the JVM (JNI
`AttachCurrentThread`, an upcall): their starts carry no stack and no parent thread, and a
library that attaches for every callback starts one each time, which by name looks like
any `Thread-N`.

**`--thread GLOB`** adds how the matching threads were started: how many, the most in
100 ms and in a second and when, and the code that started them (the innermost frame
outside the JDK in the starting thread's stack, with the threads that ran it).

## 7. `alloc`

`alloc --sites` ranks one row per allocating method — the innermost frame outside the JDK
— so every path that reaches it is summed instead of ranked separately; the row says how
many stacks it stands for and how many samples are behind all of them.

When that method is in a library you cannot change, `--app com.example` moves the
attribution to your own innermost frame; the report lists the packages it saw, so the
value to pass is in front of you. `--app` takes a comma-separated list of class or package
prefixes, each matching at a `.` or `$` boundary: `io.netty` matches `io.netty.buffer` and
`io.nett` matches neither, and `com.example.Handler` matches its nested classes and
lambdas (`com.example.Handler$Inner`) but not `com.example.HandlerFactory`.

`--baseline before.jfr` compares two recordings: what changed between the recording
before the fix and the one after.

## 8. `locks` and `stalls`

`locks --by-site` does for lock instances what `alloc --sites` does for allocations:
fifteen queues of the same kind become one row of fifteen instances, ranked across all of
them.

**Idle threads.** A thread parked on its own empty queue is not contention and is not a
stall: `locks` lists those apart and `stalls` leaves them out. They are recognised by the
frame of a pool waiting for work (`locks --idle` replaces the list; in `stalls`, a sleep,
wait or park under a frame `--idle` names is idle too) and, for a worker loop no list
knows about, by shape — one thread, no holder, most of the recording parked there.

**Moved locks.** A lock the collector moved has several addresses, so its pieces can each
fall short of that; `locks` lists them under `MOVED BY THE COLLECTOR`, still counted, and
`stalls` names them in a warning, because only timing says the pieces are one object.

**Timer loops.** `stalls` also leaves out a timer loop: a thread whose waits from one
place ran out the timeout it chose, at least twice and for more than half its life (a
`java.util.Timer`, a cleaner, a periodic poll); the recording says which waits timed out,
so no list is needed. One wait that timed out is still a stall, and a warning names the
five threads with the most time set aside and counts the rest.

**`--idle none`** turns all of this off, and in `stalls` it also empties the list of idle
frames, so no sample is idle: a loop sitting in its selector counts as working.

**Evidence.** Every stall says how it was found: nothing after the detail means a
blocking event, exact to its timestamps; `[samples]` means a run of sampler observations;
`[silence]` means an absence of samples explained by what covered it.

**Unseen.** Anything a blocking event or a pause event explains is exact; anything that
rests on samples alone is only as good as the sampling cadence. `jfrq` measures that
cadence per thread, and `stalls` opens with an `Unseen` line when it is too coarse:
first, in one line, how short a stall no event explains can be and still go unseen on the
threads you asked about; then, under it, whether the sampler's pace or the thread's own
absences are why, and the sampling period that would help.

## 9. `health`

`health` reads what the other commands leave: the collector's own events, the JVM's
once-a-second statistics and the throwables it created.

**Findings.** An `OutOfMemoryError` for direct memory, a failed evacuation, a full
collection, GC time or pauses over the collector's own goals, a collection forced by a
humongous allocation, metaspace or `System.gc()`. A finding is only something the JVM
itself reported, each with when it happened (`5 collections caused by Metadata GC Threshold, from +0.487s to +1.152s` is a
JVM starting; the same five spread over an hour are classes loaded faster than they are
unloaded).

**Trends** are numbers without a verdict: each series has its start, end, range and the
floor of its first and last thirds, so heap after GC whose floor climbs is growth that did
not come back down, and whether that matters is yours to say. When the floor of heap
after GC rose, by more than its printed figures round away, it says the recording cannot
tell what holds the heap (`jdk.OldObjectSample` names where objects were allocated), and
that a class histogram or a heap dump can.

**CPU.** Under the trends, `health` adds the CPU the Java threads used by their own
readings, and on macOS warns at the top when the JVM's own figure (`jdk.CPULoad`) is below
it: a process uses at least what its threads do, and on one JDK 21.0.3 macOS soak the JVM
reported 0.2 % while its threads reported 8.0 %. (On Linux the JVM's figure divides by the
host's CPUs, so the two do not compare.)

**Native memory.** A JVM run with `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` writes NMT's
committed memory by category, which `health` lists with the same floors; resident set
minus committed heap is not native growth, because the heap becomes resident as it is
touched.

**Throwables** are counted exactly from `jdk.ExceptionStatistics` and ranked from
`jdk.JavaExceptionThrow`, which fires in the constructor: a site is the code that made the
throwable, past its own constructors and factory. JFR records an `OutOfMemoryError` only
when Java code constructs one (direct buffer memory): the JVM makes its own, for the heap
or metaspace, and every `StackOverflowError`, without running a constructor, so they never
reach the file. A failed evacuation is the step before a heap one. A few
`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`s whose message names `java.lang.invoke.Invokers$Holder` are
the JDK linking method handles, thrown and caught inside the JDK; they are not a fault.
When a recording says `jdk.JavaExceptionThrow` was off, `health` says so and prints the
setting that turns it on ([RECORDING.md](RECORDING.md), section 3).

**Several recordings.** `jfrq health a.jfr b.jfr c.jfr` reads the recordings concurrently
and answers with one table, a row per recording in the order given (the nodes of a
cluster, or a JVM's successive runs): span, findings, GC time, heap after GC floors,
resident set, live threads, threads started, the JVM's and the threads' CPU, and
throwables per second, then each recording's findings under its name.

## 10. A killed JVM

A JVM that was killed leaves its repository directory of chunk files rather than a
recording, and `jfrq` given that directory (or the `repository=` one above it) says what
to do: `jfr assemble DIR out.jfr` joins the chunks, the last of which, the one the JVM was
writing, is unfinished and unreadable by any reader; `jfrq` then names the size to cut
`out.jfr` to so it holds only the finished ones. A repository of a single chunk holds
nothing readable.

## 11. Exit status

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | the recording cannot be read (missing, not a recording, truncated inside its first chunk, still being written), the HTML report cannot be written, or standard output cannot be written |
| 2 | a usage error |

Every option is checked before the recording is opened, so these are usage errors too: a
directory given as the recording, and an `--html` target that is a directory, sits in a
directory that is missing or not writable, or is one of the recordings being read.
