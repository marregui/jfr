/**
 * One streaming pass over a recording that feeds every event to the sinks interested in
 * its type and collects the {@link RecordingInfo} on the way.
 *
 * <p>The pass goes through {@link EventStream} rather than {@code RecordingFile} because
 * the stream parser <em>skips</em> event types nobody subscribed to at the byte level,
 * instead of materialising them. A profile recording is dominated by events no analysis
 * reads ({@code jdk.GCPhaseParallel} alone can be most of the file), so for a filtered
 * read this is the difference between parsing the file and parsing a tenth of it.
 * Event objects are reused between callbacks ({@code setReuse(true)}), so sinks copy what
 * they keep, and delivery is in file order rather than time order
 * ({@code setOrdered(false)}); every sink sorts what it keeps at the end.
 *
 * <p>Per event, the reader resolves the {@link EventType} object once (by identity; the
 * parser hands out one instance per type per chunk) to the type's name, its
 * {@link EventKinds} tag, its counter and the sinks that want it, so the per-event path
 * hashes no strings (G-2.2).
 *
 * <p>Before the pass, the chunk headers are read directly ({@link Chunks}). They give the
 * recording's data span independently of which events are subscribed, and they reveal a
 * truncated, damaged or still-being-written file, which the JDK parser would otherwise
 * turn into a silently empty answer. Complete chunks behind a damaged one are read from a
 * temporary copy without it, because the parser reads nothing after the damage. Consequences for {@link RecordingInfo}: event counts and
 * threads cover the event types that were read; the span is the file's own, taken from
 * the headers alone, so every command reports the same span for the same file (an event
 * that sticks out of it, such as a safepoint the final chunk rotation ends, is clipped by
 * the analyses like one that began before the recording). A read with an "everything"
 * sink (as {@code jfrq info} does) sees the whole file.
