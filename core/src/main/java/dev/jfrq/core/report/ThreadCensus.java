/**
 * Which threads were alive when the recording began and when it ended, and which started
 * and ended in between: the answer to "is this a leak" that the threads <em>seen in
 * events</em> cannot give. That count moves with the window's activity: a pool that starts
 * a worker per task is 39 threads in one window and 64 in the next while the census shows
 * the same 4 alive at both ends.
 *
 * <p>Alive comes from {@code jdk.ThreadAllocationStatistics}, which the JVM writes at every
 * chunk boundary with one row per live Java thread, all rows of a batch under one
 * timestamp; the earliest batch is the start of the recording and the latest its end.
 * Started and ended come from {@code jdk.ThreadStart} and {@code jdk.ThreadEnd}. The JDK's
 * {@code default} and {@code profile} settings enable all three. A thread parked through
 * the whole window, which no other event names, is in the census all the same. Starts and
 * ends are counted as events, not as threads: the JVM stops and restarts its dynamic
 * compiler threads under one id. Only the starts and ends between the two censuses are
 * counted, so that alive at start, plus started, minus ended, is alive at end: a recording
 * that begins as the JVM boots has threads that start before its first census and are in it.
 * For the same reason a start is not counted for a thread already alive: on JDK 25 the
 * {@code main} thread, in the first census of a recording made from boot, gets a
 * {@code jdk.ThreadStart} afterwards all the same.
 *
 * <p>All three cover Java platform threads only: a virtual thread is in no census, and its
 * start and end are other event types, off in both JDK profiles; the JVM's own threads
 * without a Java identity (GC workers, the VM thread) are in none of them. What they say
 * about such a thread is therefore unknown, not zero: {@link Result#covered} is every thread
 * any of the three named, anywhere in the file, and {@link RecordingSummary#threadFamilies}
 * gives no counts for a family with a thread outside it.
 *
 * <p>A start also says who made the thread: the starting thread ({@code parentThread}) and
 * its stack. A thread that native code attached to the JVM (JNI {@code AttachCurrentThread},
 * an FFM upcall from a thread the JVM did not make) has neither, and that is the only mark the
 * file gives it: a library that attaches for every callback, as RocksDB's Java event listener
 * does, starts thousands of {@code Thread-N} that look like any other thread by name. The
 * {@code java} launcher attaches {@code main} the same way. The starts are kept, with their
 * stacks, for {@link RecordingSummary#starts}.
 *
 * <p>Each Java thread's CPU comes from {@code jdk.ThreadCPULoad} ({@link ThreadCpu}).
 *
 * <p>For {@code info}, which reads every event: the sink asks for everything and keeps
 * the kinds it needs, so adding it does not narrow the pass.
