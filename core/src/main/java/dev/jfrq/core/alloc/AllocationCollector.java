/**
 * Aggregates allocation events into an {@link AllocationReport}.
 *
 * <p>Two families of events can carry the estimate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code jdk.ObjectAllocationSample} (JDK 16+): throttled samples whose {@code weight}
 *       field is the number of bytes the sample stands for. Summing weights, never counting
 *       samples, gives the estimate.</li>
 *   <li>{@code jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB} / {@code OutsideTLAB} (older recordings, or
 *       profiles that enable them explicitly): one event per new TLAB, weighted by the TLAB
 *       size, plus one per large allocation, weighted by its size.</li>
 * </ul>
 * When both are present the sampled family is used, because it is the one the JDK tunes.
 *
 * <p>One sample per thread is discarded: the first. Its weight is the bytes the thread
 * allocated since it was <em>last sampled</em>, and for a thread that was never sampled
 * before, or not since an earlier recording hours ago, that is its lifetime allocation.
 * Left in, a main thread that allocated 100 MB at start-up and nothing during a one-minute
 * recording is reported as allocating 100 MB in that minute. Dropping the sample loses at
 * most the bytes between the previous sample and this one, which for a thread sampled at
 * hundreds of times a second is nothing, and for a thread sampled once is unknowable.
 * A platform thread born in the file keeps its first sample: its lifetime began inside the
 * recording, so the weight is all in the window, and dropping it lost most of what
 * short-lived pool threads allocated. Born means a {@code jdk.ThreadStart} no later than the
 * thread's first counter reading and first sample: the JVM that starts a recording writes one
 * for {@code main} seconds after main was sampled and counted ({@link #bornInFile}).
 *
 * <p>A virtual thread loses its first sample too, and the report says how many and how
 * heavy they were ({@link AllocationReport.Dropped}). The JVM counts allocation per
 * carrier, so a sample taken on a virtual thread is weighted by what its carrier allocated
 * since the carrier was last sampled, whichever virtual threads it ran meanwhile, and a
 * carrier never sampled before carries everything it allocated since it started: 3.35 GB
 * for 67 MB allocated inside the recording, on a JVM that had been running virtual threads
 * before it. The event names the virtual thread, not the carrier, so that sample cannot
 * be told apart from an honest one; dropping every virtual thread's first sample removes
 * it whenever it lands on one, at the price of most virtual-thread allocation (a virtual
 * thread is typically sampled once or never). It does not make the estimate a floor: a
 * virtual thread that resumed on a carrier not yet sampled carries that carrier's history
 * on a later sample, which is kept.
 *
 * <p>Independently of either, {@code jdk.ThreadAllocationStatistics} (written at every
 * chunk boundary by the JDK's own settings) carries each thread's exact allocation
 * counter. The difference between its last counter and its first is what the thread
 * allocated in between, and a thread that started in the file had a counter of zero at its
 * {@code jdk.ThreadStart}; the report shows that next to the estimate, so a reader knows how
 * far the sampling is from the truth for the threads that matter. The estimate it is set
 * against is the samples inside that same stretch, which is why each platform thread's
 * samples are kept with their times (per {@link #TLAB_BUCKET_NANOS} for the TLAB events): set
 * against the whole file, a pool thread started after the first chunk had its early
 * allocation in the estimate and not in the counter, which read as an estimate 28 % high on
 * a file whose samples were right. A thread that started and ended
 * between two counter events is never counted.
 *
 * <p>The aggregation runs on primitive-valued maps and the counters on a flat list
 * (G-1.3, G-1.8); the {@code java.util} maps the report exposes are built once at the end.
